Complete backend for the development of a languages web application. Frontend developed with React:

- https://github.com/angelgr-com/nau-frontend

The objective is to develop with the PHP Laravel Framework a REST API (an Application Programming Interface following the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style).

## Application requirements

- üÜó Users must be able to register to the application, by establishing a username/password.
- ‚úÖ Users must be able to authenticate themselves to the application by logging in.
- üÜï Users have to be able to translate texts from English to Spanish or vice versa and receive their hit rate.
- üë©‚Äçüíª Users must be able find details about the text they are translating, by finding its CEFR level, difficulty and type.
- üìã Users can enter and modify their profile data.
- üÜë Users must be able to delete their profile data.
- üëã Users must be able to log out of the web application.

## Technologies

Technologies used for the development of the API:

- **Laravel**. A MVC PHP framework. 
- **Laravel/Passport** for API authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token).
- **SQL**:
  - **Eloquent**, an object-relational mapper (ORM) to interact with the database.
  - **Laravel's database Query Builder**, an interface to creating and running database queries.
- **Git-Flow**, used to code by creating a branch for each feature.
- **Heroku** to upload the app to production.

## Database model

The database uses several tables to store the application information.

The main ones are **users **and **texts **which are related through the **translations **table.

## How to use

### Online

The API is deployed in Heroku so to test the endpoints it is only necessary to use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Thunder](https://www.thunderclient.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

By downloading the following files, it is possible to import the endpoints into Postman with a set of requests ready to test endpoints:

- Users:
  - a1_lan-api_users.postman_collection.json
- Texts:
  - a2_lan-api_texts.postman_collection.json

### Local

- Clone or [download](https://github.com/angelgr-com/lan-api/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this repository.

- With [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) installed, it is possible to install [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation) by using Composer:

  ```bash
  composer global require laravel/installer
  ```

- Open the repository folder and install dependencies:

  ```bash
  cd lan-api
  composer install
  ```

- Create a new empty local schema.

- Create a .env file and enter the database configuration using environment variables:

  ```bash
  DB_CONNECTION=mysql
  DB_HOST=
  DB_PORT=
  DB_DATABASE=
  DB_USERNAME=
  DB_PASSWORD=
  ```

- Run database migrations and seeders:

  ```bash
  php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
  ```

- Generate passport keys:

  ```bash
  php artisan passport:keys
  ```

- Store the keys in the .env file:

  ```
  PASSPORT_PERSONAL_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID=
  PASSPORT_PERSONAL_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET=
  ```
  
- Start the server:

  ```
  php artisan serve
  ```
